              <h2>Why Hong Kong?</h2>
              <h3>Hong Kong literally means “Fragrant Harbour”</h3>

              <p class="p1">
                The name Hong Kong is actually a phonetic translation of the
                city’s Cantonese name 香港 (heung gong), which literally means
                “Fragrant Harbour”. Over the years, Hong Kong has been given a
                number of nicknames. It has tried to rebrand itself as Asia’s
                World City. It has also been called the vertical city, for its
                density of skyscrapers, but the name that stuck and has
                persisted for centuries is “Fragrant Harbour“.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Historians believe “Fragrant Harbour” was a name inspired by the
            city’s past as a major trading post for fragrant incense. In
            particular, agarwood, known as the “King of Incense” – just two
            ounces of precious agarwood resin can sell for thousands of dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and early part of the Qing
            dynasty (1636–1912), the villages surrounding Hong Kong, now known
            as New Territories, were noted for the production of incense.
            Agarwood was shipped, by junk boats, from a port in Hong Kong’s
            Aberdeen Harbour to provinces in China, Asia and even as far as
            Arabia.

                My name is Olga and I've been living in China for several years
                and traveled to Hong Kong very often. I'm very fond of the city.
                I created this page as part of a project fo my Portfolio and to
                develop my coding skills.
